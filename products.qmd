### Habitat Suitability Modelling of Marine Mammals

[Maps of habitat suitability and use for these marine mammal species](https://obama-next.eu/information-products/#MarineMammals) can show how ecosystems respond to environmental change and the effectiveness of conservation actions.

###  High-Resolution Predictive Maps of Processes Underlying Fish Reproduction

The model integrates different types of fisheries and survey data and returns estimates of how different processes underlying animal’s reproduction cycle are affected by environmental conditions at a local scale, as well as [predictive maps of animal and underlying reproduction processes distribution](https://obama-next.eu/information-products/#FishReproduction) along the area of interest. The model applies to the Baltic whitefish.

###  Detecting and Quantifying Macroplastic on Beaches using Drones and AI

This IP describes how [drones equipped with advanced sensors can be used to detect macroplastics](https://obama-next.eu/information-products/#Macroplastics) on beaches. Artificial Intelligence is used to quantify the amount of litter, for instance before and after a beach clean-up event. The SeaBee drone infrastructure has done proof-of-concept studies on this, which still remains to be included in monitoring.
